## Overview

LATTICE proposes an *LLM-native retrieval* paradigm that combines the efficiency of hierarchical search with the reasoning power of modern large language models. Instead of relying on a static retriever + reranker pipeline or attempting to place a large corpus directly in an LLM context, LATTICE organizes the corpus into a semantic tree and uses an LLM as an *active search agent* that navigates that tree. This design yields logarithmic search complexity while preserving the LLMâ€™s ability to perform nuanced, multi-step relevance judgments for complex, reasoning-heavy queries.

## Interactive sample prediction

Interactive Plotly view of a LATTICE search over a semantic tree: the tree root is at the top and document leaves are at the bottom.  
- **Yellow path** = ground-truth route to the relevant document(s).  
- **Green intensity** = node path relevance (darker = higher relevance).  
- **Hover callouts** show the LLMâ€™s local score, calibrated latent score, child scores, and the modelâ€™s reasoning (chain-of-thought) used when expanding that node.  

Use the visualization to quickly see which branches the agent prioritized, inspect calibration effects (local vs. calibrated scores), and read the LLMâ€™s justification for traversal decisions.

### Key ideas
- **Semantic tree index:**
  - The corpus is structured offline into a hierarchy of internal nodes (LLM-generated summaries) and leaf nodes (documents). This tree constrains the search space and makes traversal efficient.
- **LLM-guided traversal:**
  - At query time, a search LLM reasons and scores small candidate slates of sibling nodes along with some calibration nodes. These local judgments drive a best-first traversal (beam expansion) instead of flat reranking.
- **Global calibration:**
  - LLM scores are context-dependent and noisy, LATTICE tries to estimate *latent* relevance scores and aggregates it into a *path relevance* score (smoothed via a momentum Î±) so nodes across branches are comparable.
- **Two tree construction strategies:**
  - (1) **Bottom-up** â€” agglomerative clustering and LLM summarization (good when passages belong to larger source documents);
  - (2) **Top-down** â€” LLM-driven divisive clustering using multi-level summaries (better when documents are conceptually distinct).

### Why it matters
- **Efficiency** â†’ Traversing a semantic tree can require fewer LLM evaluations than reranking long flat lists; search cost grows roughly logarithmically with corpus size.
- **Reasoning-aware retrieval** â†’ The search LLM's in-context reasoning allows retrieval to capture deeper, multi-step relevance signals that simple embeddings or keyword matchers miss.
- **Strong zero-shot results** â†’ In experiments on BRIGHT, LATTICE substantially improves retrieval recall and ranking quality in zero-shot settings.
